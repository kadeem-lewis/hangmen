this app is a test essentially to make sure I better understand socket.io. Goal should be some sort of good looking MVP. Users can choose their icon aand username, enter a room or create a room and play customizable rounds of hangman. There wont be any user accounts, multiple modes ( besides maybe singleplayer mode), detailed faq

- fix dynamic route not accept game code from server and breaking app
- begin watching guides on how to properly setup the initial socket.io events so they are completely stable, error free ( as much as possible ) and typesafe
- update styling and add dark mode toggle ( maybe for later )
- create figma mockups of what the pages will look like before coding them
- create a event timeline of how the game will work ( high level first and then go into greater details as I figure them out)
- players can still be present in the same room multiple times so all their messages are duplicated
- rooms are not properly distinguished
